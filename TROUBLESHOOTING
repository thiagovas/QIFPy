Common Issues.

1)
  In case Bazel shows an error like:
  
  ERROR: /home/thiagovas/L2R-Framework/euclid/BUILD:3:1: undeclared inclusion(s) in rule '//euclid:vector_operations':
  this rule is missing dependency declarations for the following files included by 'euclid/vector_operations.cc':
  '/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/6/include/stdarg.h'
  '/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/6/include/stddef.h'
  '/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/6/include/stdint.h'.
  
  
  First, try to erase the ~/.cache/bazel folder.
  If that doesn't work, recompile bazel.
  If that doesn't, cry.
